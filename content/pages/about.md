title: About

I have many interested which changed overtime, the staples that I keep finding myself back at are Guitars and Bikes. Other interests include Photography, Drums, Woodwork and DIY. 

I have been playing guitars since my early teens, but took a long break during university and early stages of career, as living in small flats never felt like it had the space for the equipment and or practice would be too noisy for neighbours. The Drums took even longer to integrate back into our home. We eventually made space for them and used a patent award for work to help pay for my first drum kit in 20 years!  

While I spend my working life on a computer keyboard, I felt I needed something more tactile to keep me interested, and so an interest in woodwork was born. Unfortunately, my workshop is an unheated space, there woodwork typically does not get much of a look in December to February. I have been taking inspiration from [Paul Sellers][ps] and [Christopher Schwarz][cs]. 

Paul sellers has a [great book][book1] on sharpening, setup and using hand tools. Christopher Schwarz has been a founder of [Lost Art Press][LAP] and released some amazing books including the trilogy of anarchist design books the first of which is the [Anarchists Toolchest][ATC] or ATC for short. Note These books have been released in [PDF for free][ATC_Free] I do recommend buying them though as they are amazing books.  My wood work projects and progress is under the Category [Home](/category/home.html) and the [woodwork](/tag/woodwork) tag.
