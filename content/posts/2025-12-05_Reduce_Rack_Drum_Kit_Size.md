For the Yamaha DTX8 the cymbals mount on to the horizontal drum rack tubes. A more compact setup can be achieved if the cymbal mounts are onto of the vertical tubes. Some drum racks already have this setup, typically on the lower end as it requires less harder to be supplied. It seems like a great way to save space if trying to fit a drum kit into your home!  [Gibraltar have this clamp][1], to convert other drum racks with (1.5”) 38.1mm tubing.
