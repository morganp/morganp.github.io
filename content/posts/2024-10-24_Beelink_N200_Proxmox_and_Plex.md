To improve the Plex transcoding options and off load the computation from the NAS, the plan is purchase a BeeLink EQ13 Alder Lake N200 16GB Ram and 500GB Drive, currently for sale at Â£215.

The Beelink will then have [proxmox][proxmox] installed as the main operating system. 
A docker container for Plex and the other dockers that are currently hosted on the NAS box.

Theguide for plex install I will be following [here][guide].

A virtual machine for Hssistant OS can also be installed to run [HomeAssistant][HomeAssistant].
