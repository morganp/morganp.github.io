</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>While enjoy photography I am not that interested in portrait, fashion or lifestyle photography but for some reason I decided to watch the <a href="http://jeremycowart.com/">Jeremy Cowart</a> classes on <a href="http://kelbytraining.com/">Kelby Training</a>. The two classes I watched were the <a href="http://kelbytraining.com/course/cowart_on_location_1/">On Location Part 1</a> and <a href="http://kelbytraining.com/course/cowart_on_location_2/">On Location Part 2</a>. </p>
<p>I found these on location classes really interesting, Scott Kelby shadowing Jeremy and asking questions while he was shooting. Seeing this insight into how people approach a shoot and what they look for to make the picture.  Jeremy has a great ability to find interesting backgrounds for portraits. Shoots in mostly manual and using simple lighting setups starting with natural light and bringing in a reflector and or strobe when required.</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/">Jeremy Cowart</a> Also has a 4 hour DVD out covering 7 shoots, <a href="http://lifefinderdvd.com/">LIFEFINDER</a>. I have not watched this yet but based on what I have seen from Jeremy it is going to be really good, expect it to cost around $150.</p>
