</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Finally got my mac mini to accept the 8GB kit I bought from <a href="http://www.crucial.com/uk/">Crucial</a> for £74 (apple upgrade is £409).</p>
<p>The Mac mini since mid 2010 has been designed to have user upgradable
 memory. I however ran in to some issues with it not recognising the new memory, not quite which step fixed it:</p>
<p>First reboot, while switching back on press and hold cmd-opt-p-r <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379">Resetting PRAM and NVRAM</a>. This will causes it to continuously reboot, switch off after a cylce not letting it boot up.</p>
<p>Second, Disconnect all cables, open up the back and take the old memory out. pulling the clips to the side the memory pops up at about 45degrees.</p>
<p>Third, insert lower memory, really make sure this is firmly in place by pushing in firmly while at 45-30Degeees,then press down to clip into place. non of the metal from the contacts should be showing. I think this was my main mistake when inserting this memory the first few times. Then insert the second RMA module in the higher position, this seats much easier.</p>
<p>Fourth, Replace back/bottom of mac mini then hold the power button down/in for 4 seconds. This causes a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964">SMC reset</a>.</p>
<p>Last reconnect cables and power up. You can use /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app to check how much memory you now have.</p>
<p>If the mac just beeps, it is quite likely that the memory is not seated correctly. On a very rare occasion it would be due to a faulty memory chip. They should work one at a time in the top position though so you could test them that way.</p>
